							Although the ingredients of the BLT have existed for many years, there
							is little evidence of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. The 1903 Good
							Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe by a Dr. Evan Mee for a club
							sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of
							turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. While the 1928 book Seven
							Hundred Sandwiches by Florence A. Cowles does include a section on bacon
							sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.
							<br>
							<br>
							
							The BLT became popular after World War II because of the rapid expansion
							of supermarkets, which allowed ingredients to be available year-round.
							The initials, representing "bacon, lettuce, tomato", likely began in the
							U.S. restaurant industry as shorthand for the sandwich, but it is
							unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness. For example,
							a 1951 edition of the Saturday Evening Post makes reference to the
							sandwich, although it does not use its initials, describing a scene in
							which: "On the tray, invariably, are a bowl of soup, a toasted sandwich
							of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a chocolate milk shake."
							<br>
							<br>

							A 1954 issue of Modern Hospital contains a meal suggestion that
							includes: "Bean Soup, Toasted Bacon Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich,
							Pickles, Jellied Banana Salad, Cream Dressing, and Pound Cake." By 1958,
							Hellmann's Mayonnaise advertised their product as "traditional on bacon,
							lettuce, and tomato sandwiches," suggesting that the combination had
							been around for some time. However, there are several references to a
							"B.L.T" in the early 1970s, including in one review of Bruce Jay
							Friedman's play entitled Steambath titled: "A B.L.T. for God â€“ hold the
							mayo.". The abbreviation used in title references a line of dialogue in
							the play in which God yells, "Send up a bacon and lettuce and tomato
							sandwich, hold the mayo. You burn the toast, I'll smite you down with my
							terrible swift sword." The coexistence of the shortened version and the
							full name suggests this was a period of transition as the abbreviation
							was popularized.

							According to the YouGov survey, grilled cheese tops the list of the most
							popular sandwiches in America. Until 2019 the BLT had been ranked as the
							second most popular sandwich in the US and as the UK's favourite
							sandwich. In 2019 the BLT dropped rank and was voted the sixth most
							popular sandwich in the US, with grilled cheese taking the lead at the
							most popular sandwich in the United States. As the sixth most popular
							sandwich in the United States it falls behind the ham sandwich, the
							roast beef sandwich, turkey sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, and
							finally, the Grilled cheese sandwich. And a poll by OnePoll in 2008
							showed that the BLT was the "nation's favourite" sandwich in the UK. BLT
							sandwiches are popular especially in the summer, following the tomato
							harvest. In the United States, the BLT-season is associated with an
							increase in the price of pork-bellies, which are processed into bacon.
